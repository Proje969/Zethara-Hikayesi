            <h1>Chapter 4: Heart of Zethara</h1>
            
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>After the Fire Guardians left the Crystal Peak, the questions echoing in Kael's mind wouldn't stop. The clue from the Crystal pointed to Zethara's heart being buried in the Red Talisman Forests. However, every path leading there required both physical and spiritual effort.</p>

                <p>When the group reached the forest's border, each member seemed lost in their own thoughts. Aera continued to lead the group while examining the map. Kael was evaluating Zethara's prophecies in his mind. Lirien was humming a soft song to keep the group's morale up. However, no one was aware of the approaching danger.</p>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Opportunity in the Shadows</h2>
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"I can feel the talisman's intensity in this forest." - Kael</p>
                        <p class="quote">"And is that a good thing or a bad thing?" - Aera</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Talismans depend as much on who uses them as what they are. We'll learn that here." - Kael</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"But what does this heart mean for us? Do we want Zethara to return to her old self?" - Lirien</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Zethara's heart isn't just an object. It's the core of Zethara's memories and passions. This is her red and fiery contradiction. What we do here will determine not just her future, but the future of the entire world." - Kael</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Enchanted Gateway</h2>
                    <p>As the group advanced deeper into the forest, the energy in the air began to intensify. Suddenly, a glowing geometric pattern appeared on the ground before them. The pattern looked like it had a large crystal symbol drawn in the center of the circle.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"This could be a talisman gateway. But... I'm not sure which key will open it." - Aera</p>
                        <p class="quote">"I think we can try an experiment. Do you remember the codes we obtained at Crystal Peak?" - Kael</p>
                        <p class="quote">"What happens if we make a mistake?" - Lirien</p>
                        <p class="quote">"If we make a mistake, we could get lost in this forest forever. But we can't be afraid of losing right now." - Kael</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Shadows of Zethara's Heart</h2>
                    <p>When they passed through the talisman gateway, an enormous hall appeared around them. On the walls, intense flames could be seen mixed and frozen in a crystallized form. In the center, on a pedestal rising from the ground, stood a magnificent crystal, grand enough to be called Zethara's Heart.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"This is it." - Aera</p>

                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Meeting the Guardian</h2>
                    <p>Kael approached the heart with slow steps. But just as he was about to touch it, a voice echoed:</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"Stop!" - Fire Guardian</p>
                        <p class="quote">"I am the Fire Guardian... the last keeper of Zethara's Heart. You cannot touch this crystal without passing my test." - Fire Guardian</p>
                        <p class="quote">"If you want a test, we're here." - Aera</p>
                        <p class="quote">"But we're not just here for a battle. Let us explain our purpose." - Lirien</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Then it will be a test requiring wisdom, courage, and heart. Prepare yourselves!" - Fire Guardian</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="chapter-end">The group prepared to face the guardian's test, but the same question echoed in all their minds: How would this world change depending on whose hands Zethara's heart fell into?</p>
