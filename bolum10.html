            <h1>Chapter 10: Endless Corridors</h1>
            
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>The door that appeared after Kael touched the Heart of Fire led to a series of endless corridors. These corridors were neither in the physical world nor in the realm of shadows - they existed in a space between both realms. Each step they took echoed with the whispers of ancient memories.</p>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Guide of Shadows</h2>
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"These corridors... They're like a labyrinth of memories." - Lirien</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Not just memories. Each corridor represents a different possibility, a different destiny." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The group turned toward the voice. A figure formed from shadows stood before them. This was the Guide of Shadows, the guardian of the endless corridors.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"You carry the Heart of Fire. But do you know what price you must pay to use it?" - Guide of Shadows</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Whatever the price, we're ready to pay it." - Kael</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Are you sure? The price might be more than just your life." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Test of Destiny</h2>
                    <p>The Guide of Shadows led them through the corridors. Each corridor showed a different version of Zethara's story. Some showed her as a savior, others as a destroyer. But in each story, there was always a price to be paid.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"Each story is real, and each is false. The truth lies in the choices you make." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                        <p class="quote">"But how can we know which choice is right?" - Aera</p>
                        <p class="quote">"There is no right choice. There is only the choice you're willing to live with." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Final Choice</h2>
                    <p>Finally, they reached a chamber where three doors stood. Each door showed a different future.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"The first door leads to a future where Zethara remains in chains, but the world is at peace." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                        <p class="quote">"The second door leads to a future where Zethara is free, but her power might destroy everything." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                        <p class="quote">"And the third door?" - Kael</p>
                        <p class="quote">"The third door leads to uncertainty. A future that even I cannot see." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>Price of Power</h2>
                    <p>Kael stepped forward, the Heart of Fire glowing in his hands. He could feel Zethara's power flowing through him, but also her pain.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"We didn't come this far to choose between certainties. Sometimes the greatest courage is to step into the unknown." - Kael</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Are you sure about this?" - Aera</p>
                        <p class="quote">"No. But I believe in us, in our strength together." - Kael</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Kael reached for the third door. As his hand touched the handle, the Heart of Fire began to pulse with an intense light.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"Remember, whatever lies beyond this door will change everything. There's no turning back." - Guide of Shadows</p>
                        <p class="quote">"We're ready." - Kael</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <h2>New Beginning</h2>
                    <p>As the door opened, a blinding light filled the chamber. The Heart of Fire merged with Kael's being, and Zethara's voice echoed one last time:</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"You chose not to control my power, but to share my burden. Perhaps this is the wisdom I've been waiting for all these years." - Zethara</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The light engulfed them all, and when it faded, they found themselves in a transformed world. The realm was neither consumed by fire nor trapped in shadow - it was something new, something that had never existed before.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="quote">"What happens now?" - Lirien</p>
                        <p class="quote">"Now we build something new. Together." - Kael</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="chapter-end">And so ended the story of the Fire Queen and began a new chapter in the history of the realm. The price had been paid, the burden shared, and a new destiny forged in the flames of courage and the shadows of wisdom.</p>
